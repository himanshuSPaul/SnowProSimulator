I am preparing for SnowPro Exams. Generate a comprehensive Q&A question bank 
as a YAML file for the following:
  Topic: Virtual Warehouses
  Sub-Topic: Caching
Requirements:
- Maximum 500  to 1000 questions
- Cover ALL concepts within the sub-topic exhaustively
- Mix of question types:
    * Single correct answer (multiple choice)
    * Multiple correct answers (select TWO / select THREE)
    * Scenario-based (real-world business situations)
    * Syntax/DDL/SQL query questions
    * Tricky edge cases and common misconceptions
- Difficulty distribution:
    * Easy (core definitions, basic concepts)
    * Medium (applied knowledge, calculations)
    * Hard (architecture decisions, complex scenarios, gotchas)
- Tag each question with relevant exams from:
    Core |DataEngineer |DataAnalyst |Architect
- Each question must have a detailed explanation covering:
    * Why the correct answer is right
    * Why each WRONG option is wrong
Output YAML structure:
