| No | Question | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D | Answer | Explanation | Level | Exam | Topic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A global financial services firm requires: PCI DSS compliance, 90-day audit trail via Time Travel, column masking for analysts, private network connectivity (no public internet), and ability to revoke Snowflake's access to data. Design the minimum viable Snowflake edition. | Enterprise — handles all except private network | Business Critical — all requirements met | Standard with add-ons | Virtual Private Snowflake — required for PCI DSS | B | Business Critical covers: PCI DSS compliance, 90-day Time Travel (Enterprise feature included), Dynamic Data Masking (Enterprise), PrivateLink (no public internet), and Tri-Secret Secure (revoke Snowflake access). VPS is not required unless full infrastructure isolation is mandated. | Hard | Architect | Edition Selection |
| 2 | An architect designs a multi-region active-active Snowflake deployment for a healthcare company. Which edition enables automated failover with RPO near zero? | Standard with manual backup | Enterprise with replication | Business Critical with Failover/Failback | Any edition with proper Streams configuration | C | Business Critical Edition includes BCDR with database failover and failback. Enterprise Edition supports replication but not automated failover. Business Critical provides the RPO/RTO guarantees needed for healthcare BCDR requirements. | Hard | Architect | Business Continuity |
| 3 | An architect must ensure that even Snowflake employees cannot access a customer's data. Which architecture achieves this? | Enable MFA for all Snowflake admin accounts | Deploy Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) | Enable Tri-Secret Secure with customer-managed keys | Both C and D — either achieves the goal independently | C | Tri-Secret Secure (Business Critical) means data encryption requires BOTH Snowflake's key AND the customer's CMK. Revoking the CMK makes data inaccessible to Snowflake employees. VPS provides infrastructure isolation but not necessarily key-level access control. | Hard | Architect | Business Critical Edition |
| 4 | A company runs 50 concurrent analyst workloads during business hours and near-zero at night. They want guaranteed SLA and no queuing. Which warehouse architecture and edition are correct? | One XXL warehouse, Standard Edition | Multi-cluster warehouse (min=1, max=10), Enterprise Edition, AUTO_SCALE | Single XL warehouse with auto-resize, Standard Edition | One warehouse per analyst, any edition | B | Multi-cluster warehouses (Enterprise) with AUTO_SCALE handle concurrency spikes without queuing by adding clusters. MIN=1 saves cost during off-hours. Standard Edition cannot use multi-cluster warehouses. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 5 | An architect needs to implement column-level security where different user roles see different versions of the same sensitive column without storing data twice. Which edition and feature apply? | Standard — use views with CASE statements per role | Enterprise — Dynamic Data Masking policies on the column | Business Critical — Column Encryption with role-based keys | Any edition — use Secure Views | B | Dynamic Data Masking (Enterprise Edition) applies a masking policy at the column level. The policy function evaluates the current role and returns masked or unmasked data from a single underlying column — no data duplication required. | Medium | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 6 | A Snowflake architect is designing a data mesh. Each domain team has its own Snowflake account. The architect wants to enforce data classification and tag propagation across all accounts. What is required? | Standard Edition with cross-account views | Enterprise Edition with Object Tagging and Tag-based Masking | Business Critical Edition — data mesh requires it | Single account architecture — multi-account mesh is not supported | B | Object Tagging and Tag-based Masking Policies (which allow masking policies tied to data classification tags) require Enterprise Edition. This enables governance propagation across a data mesh architecture. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 7 | A startup is choosing between Enterprise and Business Critical. They process financial data but are NOT subject to PCI DSS or HIPAA. They need 30-day Time Travel and column masking. What should the architect recommend? | Standard Edition — no compliance requirement justifies higher tier | Enterprise Edition — meets all stated requirements at lower cost than Business Critical | Business Critical — financial data always requires it | VPS — financial data requires full isolation | B | Enterprise Edition provides 30-day Time Travel and Dynamic Data Masking. Business Critical adds compliance certifications (HIPAA, PCI DSS), PrivateLink, and Tri-Secret Secure — none of which are required here. An architect should not over-provision edition tier. | Medium | Architect | Edition Selection |
| 8 | What is the architectural implication of enabling Tri-Secret Secure on an existing Business Critical account? | All existing data is immediately re-encrypted with the new CMK | The account must be rebuilt from scratch with Tri-Secret Secure enabled from day 1 | Existing data is re-encrypted transparently in the background over time | Tri-Secret Secure only applies to new data loaded after enablement | C | When Tri-Secret Secure is enabled on an existing account, Snowflake performs background rekeying of existing data to use the combined key scheme. This is transparent to users but may take time for large datasets. | Hard | Architect | Business Critical Edition |
| 9 | An architect evaluates whether to use one large Snowflake account (Enterprise) or Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS). Which is the STRONGEST justification for VPS? | The company needs 90-day Time Travel | The company needs complete infrastructure isolation — no shared metadata services with any other Snowflake tenant | The company has more than 100 concurrent users | The company needs PrivateLink network connectivity | B | VPS provides a dedicated Snowflake environment with no shared infrastructure. This is necessary for customers with extreme isolation requirements (government, certain financial regulations). PrivateLink is Business Critical; 90-day Time Travel and concurrency are Enterprise features. | Hard | Architect | Virtual Private Snowflake |
| 10 | A SCALING_POLICY=ECONOMY multi-cluster warehouse has MIN=2, MAX=6. During a low-activity period, only 1 cluster is actively processing. What happens? | The warehouse shuts the second cluster down immediately | The second cluster shuts down after the AUTO_SUSPEND period (default 10 minutes) of inactivity | Both clusters stay running — MIN=2 is always maintained | The warehouse scales down to MIN=1 automatically | B | MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT=2 means Snowflake keeps at least 2 clusters running when the warehouse is not suspended. However, when clusters beyond MIN are added due to scaling and then become idle, they shut down after the inactivity period. MIN=2 is always maintained while the warehouse is active. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 11 | An architect must implement a governance model where access to columns containing SSNs is automatically restricted based on a classification tag, not column name. Which feature set is required? | Standard Edition — secure views per column | Enterprise Edition — Object Tagging + Tag-based Masking Policies | Business Critical — Tri-Secret Secure handles this | Any edition with proper RBAC design | B | Tag-based Masking Policies (Enterprise Edition) allow masking policies to be applied automatically when a column has a specific classification tag. This is more scalable than column-name-based masking or per-column policy assignment. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 12 | What is the architectural difference between Network Policies and PrivateLink in Snowflake? | Network Policies restrict by IP; PrivateLink eliminates public internet exposure entirely — traffic stays on cloud backbone | Both achieve the same result — PrivateLink is just more granular | PrivateLink replaces the need for network policies in Business Critical | Network policies are deprecated in Business Critical Edition | A | Network Policies (all editions) filter access by source IP — but traffic still travels over the public internet. PrivateLink (Business Critical) creates a private endpoint in the customer's VPC/VNet, so traffic never leaves the cloud provider's backbone network. | Medium | Architect | Business Critical Edition |
| 13 | A Snowflake architect needs to audit who accessed which columns containing PII in the last 30 days. Which feature provides this? | QUERY_HISTORY view in ACCOUNT_USAGE | ACCESS_HISTORY view in ACCOUNT_USAGE — provides column-level lineage | Only available via Snowflake support request | Enterprise Edition audit log export to SIEM | B | ACCESS_HISTORY in ACCOUNT_USAGE (Enterprise Edition) provides column-level read and write access records — who queried which columns, when, and from which queries. This is critical for PII audit compliance. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
| 14 | An architect needs to prevent a Snowflake user from running a query that returns individual-level data — results must always be aggregated. Which feature enforces this? | Row Access Policies can block row-level results | Projection Policies prevent SELECT on specific columns | Aggregate Policies enforce minimum group sizes on query results | Secure Views filter rows automatically | C | Aggregate Policies (Enterprise Edition, Snowflake Horizon) enforce that query results must meet minimum aggregation thresholds. A user subject to an aggregate policy cannot retrieve non-aggregated individual rows. | Hard | Architect | Enterprise Edition |
