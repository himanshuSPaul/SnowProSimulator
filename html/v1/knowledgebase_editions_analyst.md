| No | Question | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D | Answer | Explanation | Level | Exam | Topic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | An analyst sees masked credit card numbers (XXXX-1234) in Snowflake but needs the full number for fraud analysis. What should they do? | Use UNMASK() function on the column | Request their Snowflake admin to grant them a role that has an unmasking policy | Query the raw table directly instead of the view | Contact Snowflake support to disable masking | B | Dynamic Data Masking is role-based. The masking policy evaluates CURRENT_ROLE() — to see unmasked data, the analyst needs to be granted a role that is excluded from masking in the policy definition. There is no UNMASK() function. | Easy | Data Analyst | Dynamic Data Masking |
| 2 | What is the purpose of a Secure View in Snowflake compared to a regular view? | Secure Views encrypt the underlying data at rest | Secure Views hide the view definition from users who have SELECT privilege — preventing inference of underlying logic | Secure Views require Business Critical Edition to create | Secure Views automatically apply row-level security | B | Secure Views (SHOW SECURE VIEW) hide the view definition from users who query it. Regular views expose the definition via SHOW VIEWS or DESCRIBE VIEW. This prevents users from inferring business logic or column names they shouldn't see. | Easy | Data Analyst | Secure Views |
| 3 | An analyst queries a table at 2 PM and gets 100 rows. At 3 PM, an engineer deletes 20 rows. The analyst runs the same query at 4 PM using AT (TIMESTAMP => '2 PM today'). How many rows are returned? | 80 rows — Time Travel reflects current state | 100 rows — Time Travel returns the data as it was at 2 PM | An error — AT syntax requires Enterprise Edition | 100 rows only if the analyst has OWNERSHIP on the table | B | Time Travel AT (TIMESTAMP => ...) returns data as it existed at that point in time — 100 rows. This works regardless of edition (Standard supports 1-day Time Travel). No special privilege is needed beyond SELECT on the table. | Easy | Data Analyst | Time Travel |
| 4 | An analyst accidentally runs UPDATE customer SET email = NULL WHERE 1=1, setting all emails to NULL. How can this be recovered? | Use UNDROP TABLE | Create table using CREATE TABLE ... CLONE ... AT (BEFORE STATEMENT => query_id) | Roll back using ROLLBACK — DML is always transactional | Contact Snowflake support — only they can recover DML changes | B | CREATE TABLE recovery_table CLONE customer AT (BEFORE STATEMENT => '<query_id>') creates a zero-copy clone of the table as it was just before the damaging UPDATE. The query_id of the UPDATE is found in QUERY_HISTORY. | Medium | Data Analyst | Time Travel |
| 5 | An analyst wants to experiment with a large production table without incurring storage costs for a copy. What is the best approach? | COPY INTO a new table — storage is deduplicated | CREATE TABLE ... CLONE — zero-copy clone shares storage until modified | SELECT INTO — creates a lightweight reference | Export to a stage and re-import when needed | B | Zero-copy cloning (all editions) creates a metadata-only copy instantly at zero storage cost. Storage cost is only incurred as the clone diverges from the source through modifications. | Easy | Data Analyst | Zero-Copy Cloning |
| 6 | A Snowflake analyst wants to share a live dataset with an external business partner who does NOT have a Snowflake account. What is the correct approach? | Export data to S3 and share the bucket credentials | Use Snowflake Data Sharing — recipients can access data through a Reader Account (Snowflake manages the account) | Data sharing requires both parties to have Snowflake accounts | Share a CSV export via the Snowflake Marketplace | B | Snowflake allows the data provider to create a Managed Account (Reader Account) for partners without Snowflake accounts. The reader account can query shared data — compute charges for the reader account are billed to the provider. | Medium | Data Analyst | Data Sharing |
| 7 | Why might an analyst's query NOT benefit from the Query Result Cache? | The analyst is using a different virtual warehouse than the original query | The query contains CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() or CURRENT_USER() non-deterministic functions | The table has not been queried in the last 7 days | Result Cache is only available in Enterprise Edition | B | Result Cache is invalidated if the query contains non-deterministic functions (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, RANDOM, CURRENT_USER, SYSDATE, etc.). The cached result could be wrong if re-used, so Snowflake bypasses the cache and re-executes. | Medium | Data Analyst | Caching |
| 8 | An analyst's query consistently takes 45 seconds. A colleague runs the exact same query 10 minutes later and it completes in 0.2 seconds. What is the most likely explanation? | The colleague's warehouse is a larger size | The Query Result Cache returned the cached result — the underlying data had not changed | The colleague has a higher priority role | The colleague's query used a different micro-partition pruning path | B | Identical queries (same SQL text, same session parameters) on unchanged data hit the Query Result Cache in the Cloud Services layer and return in milliseconds. No warehouse compute is used — this explains the dramatic speed difference. | Easy | Data Analyst | Caching |
| 9 | What does a Snowflake Marketplace listing allow an analyst to do? | Purchase raw SQL scripts from other companies | Access live, ready-to-query third-party datasets directly in their Snowflake account without ETL | Download datasets to local storage for offline analysis | Share internal tables with external parties | B | Snowflake Marketplace allows analysts to browse and access third-party live datasets (weather, financial, demographic, etc.) directly in their Snowflake account via Data Sharing. No ETL or data movement is needed — data is queried in place. | Easy | Data Analyst | Snowflake Marketplace |
| 10 | An analyst has SELECT on a table but their query returns no rows even though data exists. A colleague with SYSADMIN role can see data. What is the most likely cause? | The analyst's warehouse is too small to process the full table | A Row Access Policy is filtering rows based on the analyst's role | The analyst needs OWNERSHIP privilege to read data | The table has Time Travel enabled which is hiding current data | B | Row Access Policies (Enterprise Edition) evaluate the current user's role and return only rows they are permitted to see. An analyst with SELECT privilege may see 0 rows if the policy excludes their role — while SYSADMIN (which may be excluded from the policy) sees all rows. | Medium | Data Analyst | Row Access Policies |
| 11 | An analyst notices that a Snowflake table has a column labelled PRIVACY_CATEGORY = 'IDENTIFIER'. What does this tag indicate? | The column is the primary key — identifier of a record | The column was auto-classified as containing personally identifiable information (PII) | The column requires Business Critical Edition to query | The column is encrypted with a customer-managed key | B | Snowflake's Auto-Classification system (Enterprise Edition) applies PRIVACY_CATEGORY tags like 'IDENTIFIER', 'QUASI_IDENTIFIER', and 'SENSITIVE' to columns it detects as containing PII. This feeds governance workflows like automatic masking policy application. | Medium | Data Analyst | Data Governance Features |
| 12 | An analyst wants to use Snowflake's AI/LLM functions (like SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE) to summarise customer feedback stored in a table. What is required? | Business Critical Edition — AI features require maximum security tier | Enterprise Edition — AI features require governance controls | Any edition — Cortex AI functions are available universally | A separate Snowflake AI add-on subscription | C | Snowflake Cortex AI functions (COMPLETE, SUMMARIZE, CLASSIFY, TRANSLATE, EXTRACT_ANSWER, SENTIMENT) are available in all editions. Region availability may vary, but there is no edition restriction. | Medium | Data Analyst | Snowflake Cortex |
| 13 | An analyst needs to join a Snowflake table with a Google Sheets spreadsheet updated daily by the business team. What is the best Snowflake-native approach? | Manually export Google Sheets to CSV and reload daily | Use Snowflake's Google Sheets connector to create an external table over the sheet | Load via a scheduled Task using an API integration | Ask the business team to upload the CSV to a stage — Snowpipe handles the rest | B | Snowflake supports native Google Sheets integration (via connectors or partner tools) to query or ingest Google Sheets data. External tables or direct connector options can be used. This requires appropriate connector setup but avoids manual ETL. | Hard | Data Analyst | Connectivity Features |
| 14 | What is the Snowflake Notebook feature and which edition is required? | A documentation-only tool for writing query notes — Standard Edition | An interactive Python/SQL development environment within Snowflake — available in all editions | A Business Critical feature for secure data science workflows | An Enterprise governance tool for documenting data lineage | B | Snowflake Notebooks (powered by Snowpark) allow analysts and data scientists to write Python and SQL in an interactive notebook environment directly within Snowflake. They are available in all editions. | Medium | Data Analyst | Snowflake Notebooks |
| 15 | An analyst wants to create a visualisation dashboard using Snowflake-native tools without exporting data. Which feature enables this? | Snowflake Charts in Worksheets — basic visualisations built into the Snowflake UI | Snowsight Dashboards — shareable dashboards built natively in Snowflake UI | Snowflake Canvas — a dedicated BI tool | Both A and B — Snowsight provides both chart and dashboard capabilities | D | Snowsight (Snowflake's modern web UI) includes both in-worksheet chart visualisations and full Dashboard capabilities for sharing. These are available in all editions and do not require external BI tools. | Easy | Data Analyst | Snowsight Features |
