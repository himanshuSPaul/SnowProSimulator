| No | Question | Option A | Option B | Option C | Option D | Answer | Explanation | Level | Exam | Topic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | What is the maximum Time Travel data retention period in Snowflake Standard Edition? | 0 days | 1 day | 7 days | 90 days | B | Standard Edition supports a maximum of 1 day (24 hours) of Time Travel. Enterprise Edition extends this to up to 90 days. | Easy | Core | Standard Edition |
| 2 | Which of the following features is available in Snowflake Standard Edition? | Multi-cluster warehouses | Dynamic Data Masking | Time Travel up to 1 day | Column-level Security | C | Standard Edition includes Time Travel up to 1 day. Multi-cluster warehouses, Dynamic Data Masking, and Column-level Security all require Enterprise Edition or higher. | Easy | Core | Standard Edition |
| 3 | A company using Standard Edition wants to recover a table accidentally dropped 36 hours ago. Which statement is correct? | They can use Time Travel to recover it | They must contact Snowflake Support for Fail-Safe recovery | The data is permanently lost | They can use UNDROP TABLE within 7 days | B | Standard Edition has 1-day Time Travel. After that window, data enters Fail-Safe (7 days) which is only accessible by Snowflake Support. The data is NOT permanently lost — Support can recover it during the Fail-Safe period. | Medium | Core | Standard Edition |
| 4 | Which encryption does Standard Edition provide for data at rest? | No encryption — must be configured manually | AES-128 encryption | AES-256 encryption | Customer-managed keys only | C | All Snowflake editions, including Standard, encrypt data at rest using AES-256 encryption by default. This is automatic and requires no configuration. | Easy | Core | Standard Edition |
| 5 | What happens to the Fail-Safe period across ALL Snowflake editions? | Standard has 0 days, Enterprise has 7 days | All editions have 7 days for permanent tables | Standard has 7 days, Enterprise has 14 days | Fail-Safe is only available in Business Critical and above | B | Fail-Safe is 7 days for permanent tables across ALL Snowflake editions. It is not configurable and is managed exclusively by Snowflake Support. | Medium | Core | Standard Edition |
| 6 | Which of the following role-based access control features is available in Standard Edition? | Column-level Security | Row Access Policies | Object-level privileges (GRANT on tables, schemas) | Dynamic Data Masking | C | Standard Edition supports full object-level RBAC including GRANT on tables, schemas, databases, and warehouses. Column-level Security, Row Access Policies, and Dynamic Data Masking require Enterprise Edition. | Easy | Core | Standard Edition |
| 7 | A Standard Edition customer wants to enable HIPAA compliance. What is the minimum action required? | Sign a BAA (Business Associate Agreement) — Standard Edition supports HIPAA | Upgrade to Business Critical Edition | Upgrade to Enterprise Edition | Enable Tri-Secret Secure in Standard Edition settings | B | HIPAA compliance requires Business Critical Edition. This edition provides additional security controls (PrivateLink, Tri-Secret Secure option) and Snowflake will sign a BAA. | Medium | Core | Standard Edition |
| 8 | In Standard Edition, which statement about database replication is true? | Full database replication is included at no extra cost | Database replication is not available | Database replication requires a separate add-on license | Database replication requires Enterprise Edition at minimum | D | Database replication is available starting from Enterprise Edition. Standard Edition does not include cross-region or cross-cloud replication capabilities. | Medium | Core | Standard Edition |
| 9 | A Standard Edition account has DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS set to 1. A developer drops a table at 9 AM Monday. At what point does Fail-Safe begin? | Immediately when the table is dropped | 9 AM Tuesday (after 24-hour Time Travel window) | 9 AM the following Monday (7 days later) | Fail-Safe does not apply to Standard Edition | B | Time Travel runs for 1 day (until 9 AM Tuesday). After that, Fail-Safe begins and runs for 7 days (until 9 AM the following Tuesday). Both periods run sequentially. | Hard | Core | Standard Edition |
| 10 | What is the maximum Time Travel retention period available in Enterprise Edition? | 1 day | 7 days | 30 days | 90 days | D | Enterprise Edition supports Time Travel data retention up to 90 days. This is configurable at the account, database, schema, or table level. | Easy | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 11 | Which feature, introduced at Enterprise Edition, eliminates resource contention for concurrent workloads? | Auto-suspend | Result Cache | Multi-cluster Virtual Warehouses | Query Acceleration Service | C | Multi-cluster warehouses (available from Enterprise Edition) allow a warehouse to automatically scale out additional clusters when query concurrency increases, eliminating queuing. | Easy | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 12 | A company needs analysts to see masked credit card numbers (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234) while DBAs see full numbers. Which feature enables this? | Row Access Policies | External Tokenization | Dynamic Data Masking | Column Encryption | C | Dynamic Data Masking (Enterprise Edition) applies masking policies to columns. Different roles see different representations of the same data without duplicating it. | Easy | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 13 | What is the minimum Snowflake edition required to use Row Access Policies? | Standard | Enterprise | Business Critical | Virtual Private Snowflake | B | Row Access Policies are part of Snowflake's Horizon governance suite and require Enterprise Edition or higher. | Easy | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 14 | An Enterprise Edition warehouse is configured with MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT=1 and MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT=5 in AUTO_SCALE mode. 200 queries arrive simultaneously and the warehouse is X-Large. What happens? | All 200 queries queue behind the single cluster | Up to 5 additional clusters spin up to handle the load | The warehouse automatically resizes to a larger size | An error is returned — concurrency limit exceeded | B | In AUTO_SCALE mode, Snowflake adds clusters (up to MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT=5) when queries queue. The warehouse scales out horizontally, not vertically. Queries are distributed across clusters. | Medium | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 15 | Which statement about Periodic Data Rekeying in Enterprise Edition is true? | Keys are rotated daily by default | Snowflake periodically re-encrypts data with new keys automatically | The customer controls when rekeying happens | Rekeying is only available in Business Critical Edition | B | Enterprise Edition includes Periodic Data Rekeying — Snowflake automatically re-encrypts data with new keys on a rolling basis. This is transparent to users and requires no action. | Medium | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 16 | A table in Enterprise Edition has DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS=90. It is dropped on Day 1. On Day 85, a developer uses AT (TIMESTAMP =>...) to query the historical data. What is true? | Query succeeds — within the 90-day Time Travel window | Query fails — Time Travel only works within 7 days of dropping | Query fails — dropped tables cannot be queried via Time Travel | Query succeeds only if UNDROP TABLE is run first | A | Time Travel on dropped (but not yet purged) objects works within the retention window. A dropped table with 90-day retention can be queried with AT/BEFORE for up to 90 days. UNDROP restores it; AT/BEFORE queries it without restoring. | Hard | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 17 | What does SCALING_POLICY = ECONOMY do in a multi-cluster warehouse? | Shuts down idle clusters after 1 minute | Waits until a cluster is fully loaded before adding another cluster | Prevents scale-out entirely — only scale-up is allowed | Routes all queries to the cheapest available cluster | B | ECONOMY scaling policy conserves credits by waiting until a new cluster is fully justified (existing cluster fully utilised) before starting another. STANDARD policy starts a new cluster as soon as queries begin queuing. | Medium | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 18 | Which two features are BOTH exclusively available starting from Enterprise Edition? (Choose the correct pair) | AES-256 encryption + Time Travel | Multi-cluster warehouses + Dynamic Data Masking | Auto-suspend + Result Cache | Fail-Safe + Object-level RBAC | B | Multi-cluster warehouses and Dynamic Data Masking both require Enterprise Edition. AES-256, Time Travel (1 day), Auto-suspend, Result Cache, Fail-Safe, and RBAC are all available in Standard Edition. | Medium | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 19 | An Enterprise Edition account has a table with 90-day Time Travel. DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS is changed from 90 to 1. What immediately happens to the historical data beyond 1 day? | It remains accessible for the remaining original 90-day window | Access is immediately cut off; data will be purged in background | It moves to Fail-Safe automatically | Nothing changes until the table is dropped | B | Reducing DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS immediately restricts Time Travel access to the new window. Historical data beyond 1 day becomes inaccessible immediately, though physical purge happens asynchronously in the background. | Hard | Core | Enterprise Edition |
| 20 | Which compliance framework is supported ONLY in Business Critical Edition and above? | SOC 2 Type II | ISO 27001 | HIPAA / HITRUST | PCI DSS + HIPAA | D | Business Critical Edition is required for HIPAA/HITRUST and PCI DSS compliance. SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 are supported across all editions. | Easy | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 21 | What is AWS PrivateLink (and its equivalents) in the context of Snowflake editions? | A feature available in all editions for secure inter-region transfer | A Business Critical Edition feature ensuring traffic never traverses the public internet | An Enterprise Edition feature for VPN connectivity | A Standard Edition networking option | B | PrivateLink (AWS), Private Service Connect (GCP), and Azure Private Link are available in Business Critical Edition. They ensure Snowflake traffic stays on the cloud provider's internal network. | Easy | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 22 | What is Tri-Secret Secure in Snowflake? | Three-factor authentication for Snowflake users | A combination of Snowflake-managed key + customer-managed key (CMK) required to decrypt data | Encryption of data in transit, at rest, and in use simultaneously | A feature where three admins must approve data access | B | Tri-Secret Secure (Business Critical) combines Snowflake's internal key with a customer-managed key (CMK) stored in AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault/GCP KMS. Both keys are required — if the customer revokes their CMK, data becomes inaccessible to everyone including Snowflake. | Medium | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 23 | A Business Critical customer revokes their AWS KMS customer-managed key (CMK). What is the immediate effect? | Only new data is inaccessible; existing data remains readable | All data becomes inaccessible to everyone, including Snowflake support | Only external tables are affected | Data remains accessible for 24 hours before lockout | B | Tri-Secret Secure design means BOTH keys are required. Revoking the CMK immediately makes all data inaccessible — this is the intended security guarantee, protecting even against Snowflake insider access. | Medium | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 24 | Which feature allows Business Critical Edition customers to ensure database failover to another region? | Zero-Copy Cloning across regions | Time Travel with 90-day retention | Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) with Failover/Failback | Snowpipe auto-recovery | C | Business Critical Edition includes BCDR features — database replication with automated failover and failback across regions and clouds. This is separate from standard replication available in Enterprise Edition. | Medium | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 25 | A financial services company needs: HIPAA compliance, column masking, 90-day Time Travel, PrivateLink, and customer-managed encryption keys. What is the MINIMUM required edition? | Standard | Enterprise | Business Critical | Virtual Private Snowflake | C | HIPAA compliance, PrivateLink, and customer-managed keys (Tri-Secret Secure) all require Business Critical Edition. The other features (masking, 90-day Time Travel) are Enterprise features — but since Business Critical includes all Enterprise features, Business Critical is the minimum. | Hard | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 26 | What is 'Customer Dedicated Metadata Store' and which edition provides it? | An Enterprise Edition feature for dedicated query history storage | A Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) feature — fully isolated metadata infrastructure | A Business Critical feature for HIPAA metadata compliance | A Standard Edition add-on for dedicated metadata encryption | B | Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS) is the highest tier, providing a completely isolated Snowflake environment — dedicated metadata store, dedicated services layer, no shared infrastructure with other Snowflake customers. | Hard | Core | Virtual Private Snowflake |
| 27 | Which Snowflake edition supports OAuth integration with external identity providers for SSO? | Standard Edition only | Enterprise Edition and above | Business Critical and above | All editions | D | OAuth, SAML 2.0 SSO, SCIM, and MFA are available across all Snowflake editions. Authentication and identity management features are not restricted by edition. | Medium | Core | Security Features |
| 28 | What is the difference between Standard Edition's network policy support vs Business Critical's PrivateLink? | Network policies block IPs; PrivateLink routes traffic through the cloud provider's private backbone (never public internet) | PrivateLink is just a more advanced IP whitelist | Network policies require Enterprise Edition | There is no difference — both achieve the same result | A | Network policies (all editions) filter traffic by IP address but traffic still travels over the public internet. PrivateLink (Business Critical) creates a private endpoint — traffic between the customer's VPC and Snowflake never touches the public internet. | Hard | Core | Business Critical Edition |
| 29 | Which of the following features is available in ALL Snowflake editions? | Multi-cluster warehouses | Dynamic Data Masking | Fail-Safe (7 days) | Row Access Policies | C | Fail-Safe (7 days for permanent tables) is available in all editions including Standard. Multi-cluster warehouses, Dynamic Data Masking, and Row Access Policies require Enterprise Edition. | Easy | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 30 | A company evaluates Standard vs Enterprise. Their key requirements are: 30-day Time Travel and masking PII columns for analysts. What edition do they need? | Standard Edition meets both requirements | Enterprise Edition is needed for both requirements | Standard Edition for Time Travel; Enterprise for masking | Business Critical Edition — both features require it | B | Both requirements need Enterprise Edition. Standard Edition only supports 1-day Time Travel. Dynamic Data Masking (column masking) is also an Enterprise feature. | Easy | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 31 | Snowflake Search Optimization Service — what is the minimum edition required? | Standard | Enterprise | Business Critical | Available on all editions | D | Search Optimization Service is available on all Snowflake editions. However, it is billed as an additional compute cost on top of the warehouse usage. | Medium | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 32 | A startup uses Standard Edition. They need to share live data with a partner company in a different Snowflake account. Is this possible? | No — Secure Data Sharing requires Enterprise Edition | Yes — Secure Data Sharing is available in all editions | Yes — but only read-only shares within the same region | No — Data Sharing requires Business Critical for compliance | B | Secure Data Sharing via Snowflake Marketplace and direct sharing is available in all editions including Standard. There is no edition restriction on data sharing. | Medium | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 33 | Which governance feature requires Enterprise Edition AND is NOT available in Standard? | GRANT privilege on objects | Time Travel | Aggregate Policies (data aggregation enforcement) | Fail-Safe | C | Aggregate Policies (which enforce that query results must be aggregated before returning) are part of Snowflake Horizon governance and require Enterprise Edition. Basic GRANT, Time Travel (1 day), and Fail-Safe are in Standard. | Hard | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 34 | Snowflake Cortex AI features (LLM functions like COMPLETE, CLASSIFY) — what edition is required? | Enterprise Edition only | Business Critical only | All editions — Cortex is available universally | Virtual Private Snowflake only | C | Snowflake Cortex AI functions are available across all editions. However, certain Cortex features may have region availability constraints regardless of edition. | Medium | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 35 | A company in Standard Edition wants to query external tables over S3. What is true? | External tables require Enterprise Edition | External tables are available in all editions | External tables require Business Critical for security | External tables are not supported in Standard Edition | B | External tables (querying data in external stages like S3, Azure Blob, GCS) are available in all Snowflake editions including Standard. | Easy | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 36 | What is the correct edition ordering from lowest to highest tier? | Standard → Business Critical → Enterprise → VPS | Standard → Enterprise → Business Critical → VPS | Enterprise → Standard → Business Critical → VPS | Standard → Enterprise → VPS → Business Critical | B | The correct tier order is: Standard → Enterprise → Business Critical → Virtual Private Snowflake (VPS). Each tier includes all features of lower tiers plus additional capabilities. | Easy | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 37 | A table in Standard Edition has the default DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS. A DBA wants to extend it to 30 days for compliance. What happens? | ALTER TABLE succeeds — Standard Edition allows up to 90 days | ALTER TABLE fails with an error — Standard maximum is 1 day | The value is silently capped at 1 day | Standard Edition requires upgrading first; command fails | B | In Standard Edition, DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS cannot exceed 1. An attempt to set it higher results in an error. The account must be upgraded to Enterprise Edition to configure retention beyond 1 day. | Hard | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
| 38 | Which of the following is true about Snowflake credits consumption and editions? | Enterprise Edition warehouses cost more credits per hour than Standard warehouses of the same size | Credit consumption per compute hour is the same regardless of edition — edition affects features, not credit rates | Business Critical costs 2x credits compared to Standard | VPS accounts have no credit model — they use a flat subscription | B | A Large warehouse consumes the same number of credits per hour regardless of whether the account is Standard, Enterprise, or Business Critical. Edition pricing affects the per-credit dollar cost, not the credit consumption rate. | Medium | Core | Edition Feature Matrix |
